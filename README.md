# Audio Editing Program

Using this program, the user is able to load an audio file from their computer, play it, stop it, trim it, and save the trimmed audio.
The window displays four buttons: "Load Audio", "Play audio", "Stop Audio", and "Trim Audio". In order to use the trimming function, the user is asked to choose the start time and the end time of the new trimmed audio, in seconds. The new file is then saved on their computer.
